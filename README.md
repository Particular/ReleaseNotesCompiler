GitHubReleaseNotes
====================

**This project is no longer maintained. Consider using https://github.com/GitTools/GitReleaseManager instead**

Generates release notes for a milestone in a GitHub repo based on issues associated with the milestone.

### Conventions

* All closed issues/PR's for a milestone will be included.
* Issues/PR's with a label `Type: Bug` will be included in a `Bugs` section
* Issues/PR's not labeled as `Type: Bug` will be included in a `Features/Improvements` section
* Milestones are named `{major.minor.patch}`.
* The version is picked up from the build number (GFV) and that info is used to find the milestone.
* Release notes are generated as markdown.
